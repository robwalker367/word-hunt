# Word Hunt

Solves GamePigeon's "Word Hunt." A friend of mine, Annie, beat me at the game and bragged about it. Who's laughing now, Annie!

The dictionary (in `dictionary.txt`) is the Collins Scrabble Words (2019) dictionary, which I learned about
[here](https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/38366/latest-collins-scrabble-words-list-in-text-file) and can be
downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oGDf1wjWp5RF_X9C7HoedhIWMh5uJs8s/view).

### How To Use

Input your board in `board.txt` using capital letters with no spaces, like so:
```
ABCD
EFGH
IJKL
MNOP
```
Then make and run `./solver`.
